Issues:
3. DefensiveStrategy tries to attack black queen whereas a better move is a NextOffensive from g5 to e3
3qk2r/2r2p2/2p3p1/N1npp1Qp/1p6/1P3P2/P1P3PP/3B2KR w - - 4 36

7. NextOffensive gains priority by trying to attack bishop via b5 as opposed to defending a potential
checkmate from Q3 to Q7 by putting d7 to d5: rnb2knr/p1qpppb1/2p3pp/1p2P3/2BP4/2N2Q2/PPP2PPP/R1B1K1NR w KQ b6 0 8

9. DefensiveStrategy tries to protect knight at f6 by moving it to g8 thereby exposing queen at d8
B1bqkb1r/Q2n1p1p/p2p1np1/4p1B1/1P2P3/3p2P1/PP3P1P/RN2K1NR b KQ - 1 18

12. DefensiveStrategy tries to capture the attacking bishop whereas a better move would be put a pawn as a shield
rnbk2nr/pp1pqppp/1bp1p3/4P1B1/3P4/2PB1N2/PP3PPP/RN1QR1K1 b - - 7 10
May need to fix DefensiveStrategy to assess all offensive and shield moves together to find the best defensive move

13. DefensiveStrategy tries to move the king and not capture the attacking queen
rn2k2r/4ppbp/p1Qpq1p1/8/6P1/5P2/PPPBB2P/R3K1NR b KQkq - 6 15

14. Should protect the knight at f4 as opposed to knight at a3:
rn1qkb1r/p1p1p1pp/1p3p1n/3p1b2/5N2/N7/PPPPPPPP/R1BQKB1R b KQkq - 3 7

22. DefensiveStrategy tries to move knight to immediate capture pos e7 whereas can inflict max damage at h6
1rbq1bnr/p1pp3p/2p1kp2/4pNpQ/1P6/N1PPP1P1/PB3P1P/R3K2R w KQ - 4 14

26. DefensiveStrategy does not try to capture the checking-knight with a pawn:
r1bqkb1r/pppppppp/7n/8/8/2NBnPP1/PPPP3P/R1BQ1KNR w kq - 0 10

30. NextOffensiveStrategy should move black rook to attack white knight on next turn:
7r/q2p2k1/b6p/2p1pp2/2P4b/PN1P1P2/1N5P/5K2 b - - 13 51

31. DefensiveStrategy places black knight in a non vulnerable spot:
r1bqkbnr/1ppppppp/8/p2Pn3/5P2/4B3/PPP1P1PP/RN1QKBNR b KQkq f3 0 8

36. Nonvulnerable strategy on random iterations places white bishop before white rook:

37. Defensive strategy does not try to capture the white bishop
rn1qk2r/1bppp2p/p3PBp1/3P1p2/2P5/3B1P1N/P5PP/R2QK2R b KQkq - 0 16

40. DefensiveStrategy does not defend white queen:
1rbqk1nr/ppppp2p/5ppb/3Pn3/5Q2/5P1N/PPP1P1PP/RNB1KB1R w KQk - 2 11

42. DefensiveStrategy tries to capture attacking black bishop whereas better move is to move away to a safe position:
r3kr2/pbb3p1/nq5p/1p1Qpp2/8/P2PPPP1/5N2/RNB3KR w q - 2 31 --> FIXED

44. Strategies need to develop pieces:
r2k2nr/1bpq2b1/1p1pp2p/pP3ppn/P1PP4/4PP2/3K1NPP/RNB1QB1R w - - 14 29

45. DefensiveStrategy exposes white rook at h1:
1rqk2n1/1bp3br/1p1ppnNp/pP6/P1PP2p1/4P3/4B1PP/RNBKQ2R w - - 2 38

------------------------------------------------------------------

Feature requests:
1. CheckMateDefensiveMoveGenerator - detects opponent one and twoStep checkmates and finds a defense against it
1. CastlingMoveGenerator - develops pieces (knight and bishop and maybe Queen) to perform Queen or King side castling
2. MoreThanTwoStepCheckMateMoveGenerator - find if a combination of moves can checkmate the king by limiting his movements



-----------------------------------------

Fixed issues:

1. Does not launch a NextOffensiveMove against white-queen by moving the bishop backed by knight
rn1qkb1r/pbpppppn/1p5p/8/2QPPB2/2N5/PPP2PPP/R2BK1NR b KQkq - 4 6  --> FIXED

2. NonVulnerableStrategy tries to move rook to a vulnerable spot from d7-d3
4kbr1/p1prppp1/1p5p/4P3/5B2/8/PPP2PPP/2R1K1NR b K - 1 16  --> FIXED by adding sloppy:true in NonVulnerableSubStrategy

4. DefensiveStrategy should choose moving king from f2 to e1 as it can knock off the rook,
but instead chooses f2 to g3 and looses its own rook
8/q1r3k1/5pp1/3p3p/8/1P3P2/P1P2KPP/2NBr2R w - - 8 48  --> FIXED

5. Breaks down at: 4kb1r/2pqpppp/2pp1n2/r7/p1b1P3/P1N2P1P/1PPP1KP1/RNBQ3R w k - 12 19 --> FIXED

6. DefensiveStrategy tries to attack black queen by moving knight to f6 whereas a better move
is to move the other knight at c6: rn2kbnr/p2pqppp/1p6/2pQ4/5P2/2P1P1P1/PP5P/RNB1K1NR b KQkq - 1 12 --> FIXED by ShieldMoveGenerator

8. Hangs up at 3rkb1r/3qp1pp/n1p2p2/p3P2P/Bp6/4BN2/PPP2P1P/2KR3R b k - 0 17 --> FIXED

10. Helpless Queen should takedown the most valuable piece if it has no defense left
rnb1kb1r/pp1pp2p/2p2ppn/8/q1B1P3/1P1P4/P1PBQPPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq - 0 7 --> FIXED

11. Hangs up after fix for 10: rnb1kb1r/pp1pp2p/2p2ppn/8/q1B1P3/1P1P4/P1PBQPPP/RN2K1NR b KQkq - 0 7 --> FIXED

15. DefensiveStrategy moves king which is not in danger and does not protect rook:
rnbqk1nr/pRp1pp1p/3p4/6p1/8/2P1PP2/P1PPK1PP/2BQ1BNR w kq - 1 8 --> FIXED

16. NextBestOffensive tries to give a check to black king by moving knight from f5 to g7, exposing bishop at e7
which was previously supported by this knight. NextBestOffensive should use DefensiveMoveGenerator to check if a better DefensiveMove
is now needed which indicates some other piece got exposed. If the exposed piece will be attacked by the piece targeted by NextBestOffensive,
then abort that move (score = -1), else take cumukative score
rn2k2r/1bnpBp1p/pq6/1pp1pN2/4P3/PPPP4/2Q2PPP/RN2KB1R w KQ - 2 21 --> FIXED

17. TwoStepCheckMateGenerator should first check for a OneStepCheckMate to avoid infinitely making redundant moves
7r/5Q2/nqnpNp1k/4p2p/1p2P3/5PPP/p1rNK1BR/7R w - - 16 91 --> FIXED

18. NextOffensiveStrategy should recommend putting pawn up at a6 to attack queen
1rbqkb1r/ppppp1pp/2n2p2/1Q2n3/8/P1P3PB/1P1PPP1P/RNBK2NR b k - 6 7 --> FIXED

19. DefensiveStrategy tries to protect Queen by moving it from d5 to d7 where it will eventually get captured
whereas a better move was e4
1rbqkb1r/1ppp2pp/p1n1pp2/3Qn3/8/P1P3PB/1P1PPP1P/RNBK2NR w k - 0 9 --> FIXED

20. DefensiveStrategy does not come up with a move to protect the knight a5:
1rbqkb1r/1ppp2pp/p3pp2/n3n3/Q7/P1P3PB/1P1PPP1P/RNBK2NR b k - 3 10 --> FIXED

21. DefensiveStrategy does not recommend any move, but should recommend moving knight from a5 to c4 for least overall-damage:
1rbqkbnr/pppppp1p/6p1/nB6/1P6/N1P1PNP1/P2P1P1P/R1BQK2R b KQk b3 0 7 --> FIXED

23 Invalid move from g5: br1bnk2/p1pq1prp/2p3p1/3pp1P1/PP6/2PPPP2/1B4NP/RN2QK1R w - - 1 31
Find a non-vulnerable such that best attacking score at vulnerable position --> FIXED

24. NonVulnerableStrategy should avoid moves that exposes another piece, Queen from d1-c1 exposing pawn at e2:
b3nk2/prp2prp/2p3p1/3pp1b1/PP6/B1PPPq2/3Q2NP/RN4KR w - - 0 35 --> WORKS as designed since the pawn at e2 has support from knight

25. DefensiveStrategy places knight in vulnerable spot at h4 as opposed to least damage spot at d5:
3rkb1r/pp1bppp1/2pp3p/5P2/1P1P1nP1/N1P1BB1P/P7/2KR2NR b k - 6 20 --> FIXED

27. r1b4r/pp1qppkp/2p4b/2Pp1n2/6p1/4P3/PP1QKPPP/RN3BNR w - - 4 15
Developing moves discovered by NonVulnerableStrategy: b1-a3,b1-c3,g1-f3,g1-h3
g1-f3,g1-h3 can lead to self-knight capture
Does not discver white queen moves  --> FIXED

28. DefensiveStrategy does not place pawn as a shield between Queen and opponent bishop:
rn2kbr1/pbpqpppp/1p1p1n2/1B6/4P1P1/2N2P2/PPPP3P/R1BQK1NR b KQq - 2 7 --> FIXED

38. NextOffensiveStrategy does not try to place white rook in first row to attack black queen:
